<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Aniket Raaz, pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering.
   I am in my second year and currently focusing on strengthening my programming 
   knowledge in Python, Java, and C++, while also learning Git, GitHub, and
    web development. My long-term goal is to build a strong foundation in software 
    development and later contribute to projects in AI/ML. I am also working on 
    improving my English communication and problem-solving skills to prepare for 
    opportunities like GSoC and hackathons</p>
